# **Scorpion Engine Release Notes**

## <span style='color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold'>Version 0.8.0</span>

### **New** ðŸŽ‰

1. Added new enumeration named `TextureType` to represent either whole/entire textures or sub textures that are contained inside of a texture atlas
2. Added new `EntityFactory` that can be used to generate the following types of entities:
   * Animated entities from a texture atlas
   * Non animated entities from a entire single texture
   * Non animated entities from a texture atlas
3. Added new type called `Animator` with abstractions to be able to manage animation of an entity
   * Using the new `IAnimator` interface can be used to create custom animation management
4. Added new `IInitializable` interface
   * This can be used for enforcing the `Init()` method on custom classes
5. Added new type `RenderSection` that is used by the rendering system to render sub textures of a texture atlas
   * This represents the section of a texture that rendered  
6. Added new exception `InvalidTextureTypeException` that is thrown when trying to add a new texture to an entity that is not of one of the values described in the `TextureType` enumeration
7. Added new class `InputFactory` that can be used to generate `KeyboardWatcher` and `MouseWatcher` objects
8. Added new type abstract `GameInputWatcher` type that the `KeyboardWatcher` and `MouseWatcher` inherit from
9. Added new type `KeyboardMovementBehavior` that can be used to move entities based on keyboard input
10. Created new type `BehaviorFactory` type that can be used to make it easier to generate behaviors
11. `Entity` has now been abstracted away with the interface `IEntity`
12. `Renderer` has now been abstracted away with the interface `IRenderer`
13. `StopWatch` has now been abstracted away with the interface `IStopWatch`
14. `Counter` has now been abstracted away with the interface `ICounter`
15. Added ability for entities to be flipped horizontally and vertically.  The bool properties `FlippedHorizontally` and `FlippedVertically` can be set to true or false to achieve this
16. Added additional `Render()` overloads to the `Renderer` class to allow rendering an entity to the screen at a custom X and Y location

### **Breaking Changes** ðŸ’£

1. Removed `MoveFowardKeyboardBehavior` from library
2. Removed the exception classes `EntityAlreadyInitializedException` and `EntityNotInitializedException`
3. Removed classes `DynamicEntity`, `StaticEntity`, and `TextEntity`
4. Removed the following classes dealing with content.  Content loading and atlas management is now done with the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: dodgerblue'>Raptor</span> framework
   * `AtlasData` class
   * `AtlasDataLoader` class
   * `AtlasRepository` class
   * `AtlasSpriteData` class
   * `InValidReason` enum
5. Removed the enums `AnimationDirection` and `AnimationState`
6. Removed the class `ObjectAnimation`
7. Removed the class `KeyBehavior`
   * The functionality of this class is provided by the `KeyboardWatcher` class
8. Removed the class `Behavior`
9. Removed the class `LimitNumberBehavior`
10. Renamed interface `IDrawable` to `IDrawableObject`
11. Renamed class `GameRenderer` to `Renderer`
12. Renamed interface `IBehavior` to `IEntityBehavior`
